    1 Introduction
<Paragraph summary of the technical solution that was completed including:
    • Brief project description
    • Brief description of technical environment
    • Estimated level of complexity
    • Estimated benefits/Problems it solved (quantitative & qualitative).>

    2 Technical Environment
<Detail the technical environment/technologies used to complete this project and reason for the choice of the specific technology that is used.  For instance, if PHP is used, why it is chosen and if GITHUB etc is used for source control please specify those details as well..>

    3 Overall Architecture
<Outline the overall architecture of the solution which details how the system will interact with the world or other systems etc. Explain it using a diagram.>

    4 System Architecture
<Detail the system that was built/completed. Explain each component thoroughly. A architecture diagram is essential. >

            4.1.3 .Funcitionality N

    5 Database Architecture
<Explain the database architecture/schema and why it is built in the way it is and how scalable it will be.>

    6 Implementation Instructions
< List the implementation instructions and the basic specs of the server needed. Also provide details regarding data migration or if its replacing or enhancing an existing system what are the steps needs to take to ensure there is no data loss.>
 
    7 Non-functional specifications
<Detail all the non-functional specification of the system.> 

    8 Summary of test results
<Provide the summary of the test cases and results in tabular format.>

    9 Known Issues & Risks
<Outline any known issues and/or risks that are likely to impact or be caused by this initiative in any way.>
